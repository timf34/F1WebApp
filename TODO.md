*Can't use Trello rn so will put TODOs here*

**TODO's**

- [ ] Scale image appropriately 
- [ ] Create class for Slider object
- [ ] Look into debugging/ errors in JS code. For example earlier one error was not putting `;` at the end of a line...
but I had to just notice that (didn't have any guiding errors, etc.)
- [ ] Look into what `.oninput` does in the slider JS code
- [ ] Try to instatiate the different sliders using a for loop (add them another class or object -> Sliders. It should have either an array, or a property for each slider.)
- [ ] Put slider values into a JSON object
  - This is why it would probably be useful to have a superclass(?) that contains all the sliders 
    that we have instatiated within an array. If this was Python, I would loop through the array of sliders, find 
    their values, and then add them to a json file. 
- [ ] Integrate AWS - be able to send json file to MQTT topic 
- [ ] Look into where I can host web apps
